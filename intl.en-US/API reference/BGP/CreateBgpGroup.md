# CreateBgpGroup {#referenc4e_i4w_xmt_ndb .reference}

Create a BGP group.

You can use BGP for the communication between the Virtual Border Router \(VBR\) and the local IDC.  To use BGP, add the BGP peer communicating with the VBR to the corresponding BGP group and advertise the BGP network in the VBR.

A BGP group is used for simplifying BGP configurations. You can combine repetitive configurations into a BGP group to reduce the configuration complexity.  Each BGP group is associated with an autonomous system number \(ASN\).

Note the following before creating a BGP group:

-   The supported BGP version is 4 \(BGP4\).

-   IPv4 BGP is supported, but IPv6 BGP is not supported.
