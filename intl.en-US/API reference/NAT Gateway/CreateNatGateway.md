# CreateNatGateway {#reference_i4w_x1mt_n2db .reference}

Create a NAT gateway.

Note the following before creating a NAT gateway:

-   A NAT gateway and a self-built SNAT gateway cannot coexist in a VPC.

-   After a NAT Gateway is created, a route entry of which the destination CIDR block is 0.0.0.0/0 and the next hop is the NAT Gateway is automatically added to the route table of the VPC. Therefore, traffic can be routed to the NAT gateway.

-   If a route entry of which the destination CIDR block is 0.0.0.0/0 already exists in the route table of the VPC, delete the router entry. Otherwise, the NAT gateway cannot be created.


## Specification {#section_bbb_wqb_pdb .section}

NAT Gateway has different specifications.  Different specifications correspond to different SNAT performance metrics including Max Connection and CPS, but the specification does not affect data throughput.

The relationship between NAT gateway specification and SNAT performance is as follows:

|Specification|Max Connection |CPS|
|:------------|:--------------|:--|
|Small|10 thousand|1 thousand|
|Medium|50,000|5,000|
|Large|200,000|10,000|
|Super large|1,000,000|30,000|

## Request parameters {#section_cch_pjg_mdb .section}

|Name|Type|Required|Description|
|:---|:---|:-------|:----------|
|Action|String|Yes| The action to perform. Valid value:

 CreateNatGateway

 |
|RegionId|String|Yes| The region of the NAT Gateway.

 You can obtain the region ID by calling the DescribeRegions API.

 |
|VpcId|String|Yes| The ID of the VPC.

 |
|Spec|String|No| The specification of the NAT Gateway.  Valid value:

-   Small \(default\): small

-   Middle: medium

-   Large: large

-   Xlarge. 1: super large


 |
|BandwidthPackage.n.Bandwidth|String|No| The bandwidth of the n-th NAT bandwidth package. Valid value: \[5,5000\]

 |
|BandwidthPackage.n.Zone|String|No| The zone of the n-th NAT bandwidth package. The system randomly allocates a zone if the parameter is not specified.

 If the NAT bandwidth package and the backend ECS instance are not in the same zone, the connectivity is not influenced; if they are in the same zone, the latency can be reduced.

 |
|Name|String|No| The name of the NAT Gateway.

 The name  can contain from 2 to 128 characters including a-z, A-Z, 0-9, underlines, and hyphens. The name must start with an English letter, but cannot start with `http://` or `https://`.

 |
|Description|String|No| The description of the NAT Gateway.

 The description can contain from 2 to 256 characters. The description must start with English letters, but cannot start with `http://` or `https://`.

 |
|ClientToken|String|No| A client token used to guarantee the idempotence of requests.

 This parameter value is generated by the client and must be unique. It cannot exceed 64 ASCII characters.

 |

|RequestId|String|The ID of the request.|
|NatGatewayId|String|The ID of the NAT Gateway.|
|ForwardTableIds|String| The list of forwarding entries.|
|BandwidthPackageIds|String|The NAT bandwidth package of the NAT gateway.|
