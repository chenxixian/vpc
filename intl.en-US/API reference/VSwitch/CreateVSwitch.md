# CreateVSwitch {#reference_i4w_xmt_ndb .reference}

Create a VSwitch in the specified VPC.

When calling this interface to create a switch, note:

-   Up to 24 VSwitches can be created in a VPC.

-   The first and last three IP addresses of the VSwitch are reserved by the system. For example, if the CIDR block of a VSwitch is 192.168.1.0/24, IP addresses 192.168.1.0, 192.168.1.253, 192.168.1.254, and 192.168.1.255 are reserved.

-   The number of cloud product instances under the VSwitch cannot exceed the remaining capacity of the VPC \(subtract the current number of cloud product instances from 15,000\).

-   A cloud product instance can only belong to one VSwitch.

-   VSwitches do not support broadcasting or multicasting. After a VSwitch is created, its CIDR block cannot be modified.
